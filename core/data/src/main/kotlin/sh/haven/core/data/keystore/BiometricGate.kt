/**
 * Bridges the @Singleton [sh.haven.core.security.Keystore] (which has
 * no Activity context) to an Activity-bound `BiometricPrompt`. The
 * Keystore section calls [request], the Activity collects [pending]
 * and renders the prompt, and the Activity calls [respond] with the
 * outcome — same shape as `AgentConsentManager` for agent consent.
 *
 * ### Failure model
 *
 * If no Activity is in the foreground (the user backgrounded Haven
 * between starting an SSH connect and the auth path reaching here),
 * we fail closed: [request] returns [Decision.UNAVAILABLE] immediately
 * and the Keystore.fetch reports
 * [sh.haven.core.security.KeystoreFetch.Failed]. The user has to come
 * back into the app and retry, which preserves "key never leaves the
 * store without an explicit human ack."
